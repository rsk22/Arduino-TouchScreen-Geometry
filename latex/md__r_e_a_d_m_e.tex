Library for drawing geometric shapes (polygons, rectangles, triangles, circles) to the Seeed Studio T\+F\+T touch screen

\subsection*{Introduction\+:}

This is a library created for the Arduino Uno and Seeed Studio T\+F\+T touch screen (Version 1). Here is a link to the touch screen hardware\+:

The user can create geometric shapes which include polygons, triangles, squares and circles. See the example file for a tutorial on how to do this. The code documentation under the H\+T\+M\+L folder also contains the code documentation as well.

\subsection*{Required Files\+:}

I assume you have all the necessary libraries to run basic programs on the Seeed Studio Touch Screen (i.\+e. T\+F\+T). However, note that that the following custom library is required.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Touch\+Screen (Link\+: \href{http://www.ladyada.net/library/arduino/libraries.html}{\tt http\+://www.\+ladyada.\+net/library/arduino/libraries.\+html} )
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Installation Instructions\+:}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download the zipfile.
\item Create a folder called Touch\+Screen\+Geometry under your Arduino libraries folder.
\item Install the Touch\+Screen\+Geometry.\+cpp and \hyperlink{_touch_screen_geometry_8h}{Touch\+Screen\+Geometry.\+h} files under the newly created folder.
\item All other files are (H\+T\+M\+L, Latex, etc.) are not required but are recommended. They contain the code documentation.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Documentatation\+:}

The code was thoroughly documented using D\+Oxygen. Please see the H\+T\+M\+L folder for detailed code documentation.

\subsection*{Examples/\+Tutorials\+:}

\subsection*{Bugs\+:}

There are no known bugs at this time. If you see any bugs, please contact me and I will do my best to resolve them. You may also feel free to resolve them yourself. Just check with me before you submit any updates.

\subsection*{Upgrades\+:}

We become better programmers by always looking for ways to improve our code. Thus, I will always look for ways to improve this code. If you have any suggestions for improvement or would like to make improvements yourself, please let me know.
